       <h1 class="heading"> Hi, Iâ€™m so glad you visited my website!</h1> 
       <p>Let me help you get to know me! I am an aspiring web developer. I am currently attending a boot-camp learning front-end and back-end web development! My current skills are HTML, CSS, GitHub, Javascript, Inkscape, Krita, Node and I will soon be learning Angular, Bootstrap, MongoDB, Express and Cloud9 and more.</p>
        <p> My goals are to keep learning new skills and become a top notch web developer who helps people to develop and transform their projects and make them come to life.</p>
        <p> I am currently gaining new technical skills in this new and exciting career. My past experience as a nurse has made me an excellent communicator and listener. Patience, problem-solving and being an effective team member are other qualities that I possess that will also lend to being an excellent web developer.</p>
        
        <p>More about me: Born in Ireland and currently living in San Francisco, I love to hang out with my family when I am not working. Some of the things that I love to do in my spare time are, hiking on some of the magnificent oceanside trails in San Francisco, painting, photography, reading and cooking.</p>
