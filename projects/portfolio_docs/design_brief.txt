DETAILS FOR MY PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

6 pages 1:-HOME 2:-ABOUT ME 3:-PHOTOGRAPHY 4:-PROJECTS 5:-CONTACT ME 6:-HOBBY

Colors: All my webpages have soft pastel colors. The reason I chose these colors is because I like pastel colors. My intention is to reflect a warm, comfortable feeling on to the viewer so that they will spend a longer time browsing my website. The color of all the text is black because it stands out better against each background color and is easier to read.I chose Arial as the text font because it is a web-safe color.

Text: Hi, I’m so glad you visited my website! Let me help you get to know me! I am an aspiring web developer. I am currently attending a boot-camp learning front-end and back-end web development! My current skills are HTML, CSS, GitHub, Javascript, Inkscape, Krita, Node and I will soon be learning Angular, Bootstrap, MongoDB, Express and Cloud9 and more.
My goals are to keep learning new skills and become a top notch web developer who helps people to develop and transform their projects and make them come to life.
I am currently gaining new technical skills in this new and exciting career. My past experience as a nurse has made me an excellent communicator and listener. Patience, problem-solving and being an effective team member are other qualities that I possess that will also lend to being an excellent web developer.

More about me: Born in Ireland and currently living in San Francisco, I love to hang out with my family when I am not working. Some of the things that I love to do in my spare time are, hiking on some of the magnificent oceanside trails in San Francisco, painting, photography, reading and cooking.
