<p> My name is Colette and I love to cook and taste new food! I live in San Francisco with my family. What I love about this city by the bay is to go to other neighborhoods and experience the city’s incredible variety of cuisine available. Cooking is one of my favorite hobbies and I love being in my kitchen, cooking and trying new recipes on my family and friends! Food brings people together and there is nothing more precious than spending time with family and friends over a meal! </p>

<p>About Quiche Lorraine (Link)pronounced “Keesh” in English</p>

<p>Quiche Lorraine is a classic French dish and is a regional specialty from the Lorraine area in northeast France. It is a savory dish that you can have for breakfast, lunch or dinner and is best paired with a nice salad. It resembles a pie and is light and fluffy. It is made up of a pie crust and a delicious filling made of:
</p> 
<ul>
 <li> Cheese - Gruyere cheese is the traditional cheese used in this quiche, but you can also use a Swiss cheese or gouda, cheddar, provolone, etc. You can also top the quiche with a bit of Parmesan cheese.</li>
 <li> Eggs - These are an essential part of the Quiche.
 <li>Cream - Any type of cream works.</li> 
 <li> Salt, pepper - This is optional as there will be some salt from the bacon. You can add some pepper to the top of the quiche if you like.</li>
 <li> Bacon - Use thick cut, cubed and fried bacon.</li>
 <li> Onion - A white or yellow cut thinly into slices.
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can make your own pie crust crusthttps://www.jocooks.com/recipes/pie-crust-recipe/ or you can use a store bought frozen pie crust. For this recipe, I will make it easy for you and use a store-bought pie crust. The Quiche only takes 30mins to prepare and 1 hr. 15 mins to cook in the oven.</p>

<P>There are lots of variations of Quiche e.g.</P>

<ol>
 <li>Quiche Florentine - with spinach</li>
 <li>Quiche Provençale - with tomatoes</li>
 <li>Quiche au fromage - with cheese only</li>
 <li>Quiche au champignion - with mushrooms</li>
 <li>Quiche au saumon - with salmon</li>
 <li>Tarte a l’ognion - with onion (comes from the Picardie region and that’s why it’s not called a quiche)</li>
</ol>
<p> Quiche is very versatile because you can vary the ingredients to your own taste. Other ingredients you can add are:</p> 
<p>(If you add these, it is no longer a Quiche Lorraine, it is just a Quiche!)</p>
<ul>
  <li>smoked salmon</li> 
  <li>smoked haddock</li> 
  <li>crab</li> 
  <li>cauliflower</li> 
  <li>spinach</li> 
  <li>broccoli</li> 
  <li>zucchini</li> 
  <li>peppers</li> 
  <li>feta</li> 
  <li>garlic</li> 
  <li>chives</li> 
  <li>dill </li>

<h3>Recipe Notes</h3>
<p>
Storage - Quiche can be saved to eat another day. It can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. You can also freeze it for 3 to 4 months. Because it is a custard, quiche must be refrigerated within two hours of cooling.</p>
<p>Reheat - Cover quiche with aluminum foil and bake it in an oven preheated at 325 F degrees for about 15 minutes.</p>
